<!-- Objective: Develop a web page using HTML and CSS that contains the main elements of a website structure.

Instructions:

Page Structure:

Create a web page with a header, section, aside, and footer.
The header should contain the site title and a simple navigation menu with 3 fictitious links (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
The section will be the main content area, with a paragraph explaining the website.
The aside should contain a list of external links related to the theme of the website.
The footer should include copyright information.

Styling with CSS:
Apply colors to the background of the header, section, aside, and footer.
Center the text in the header and footer.
Use a custom font (e.g., Google Fonts) for the text in the section.
Create a layout with two columns: the section on the left and the aside on the right, occupying 70% and 30% of the screen width, respectively.
Add a hover effect for the links in the navigation menu and the aside (e.g., change color on mouseover).

Minimum Requirements:
Use at least one image in the section with the alt attribute filled out correctly.
The links in the navigation menu and the aside should be clickable (even if they lead to fictitious pages).-->

        <p>The <b>Variable Trogon</b> <i>(Trogon surrucura)</i>, known for its strikingly vibrant plumage, is a bird species native to the forests of South America, particularly in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Males display a bold contrast of iridescent green or blue on their heads, necks, and backs, with a bright red belly, while females have subtler gray tones. A unique trait of this bird is its habit of staying very still on branches, making it hard to spot despite its vivid colors. Curiously, the Variable Trogon is frugivorous but also consumes insects, displaying remarkable versatility in its diet. Another interesting fact is that trogons nest in tree cavities, often excavated by other species, like woodpeckers. Despite their beauty, their soft, low calls can be surprisingly elusive in dense forests.</p>
