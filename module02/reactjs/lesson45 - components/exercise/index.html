<!-- Exercise: Counter with Lifecycle Messages
Objective:

Create a React class component called Counter that:

Allows the user to increment, decrement, and reset the counter value.
Displays specific messages in the console at each stage of the lifecycle: when the component mounts, updates, and unmounts.
Adds a check to prevent the counter from going below zero.
Requirements:

Initial State: Define an initial state with a count property equal to 0.
Buttons:
Increment: Increases count by 1.
Decrement: Decreases count by 1 (does not allow negative values).
Reset: Sets count back to 0.
Console Messages: Display messages in the following lifecycle stages of the component:
Mount: Display "Component mounted" in componentDidMount.
Update: Display "Counter updated" in componentDidUpdate.
Unmount: Display "Component will be unmounted" in componentWillUnmount.
Validation: Prevent decrementing the value if it's equal to 0.
Additional Challenge:

Alert Message: Add a message that appears in an alert when the count value is a multiple of 5.
Maximum Limit: Set a maximum limit for the counter, such as 10, and disable the increment button when the value reaches this limit. -->
